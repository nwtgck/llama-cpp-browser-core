# Browser/WebGPU enablement patches

The user explicitly authorized the implementing agent to choose upstream patches
for this image-runtime experiment on 2026-09-24. The exception is local to
`stable-diffusion-cpp`; it does not relax llama-cpp's approval policy.

`series.json` is the ordered, exact-input/exact-output inventory. Apply only to
private build-tree copies, leaving both upstream checkouts clean. The independent
llama.cpp checkout is used only as a source for its `ggml/` subtree.

1. Model reader: avoid native thread spawning in single-threaded Emscripten.
2. Group normalization: decompose contiguous channel-divisible F32 shapes into
   existing normalization/reshape operations; retain other upstream paths.
3. WebGPU memory: report unknown device capacity, not a single-buffer ceiling.
   The **application** supplies a managed-memory budget. Allocation can still
   fail; this is not a measurement of free GPU memory or driver overhead.
4. Unsplit GGUF: metadata-only v2/v3 parsing and 64-bit file positions independent
   of Wasm address width. Avoid whole-model `size_t` accumulation, validate file
   ranges/type sizes/counts and keep per-tensor memory limits. Preserve supported
   higher-rank flattening with checked arithmetic. Synchronous random-access
   sources and the decision to disable mmap/prefetch belong to the caller.
5. GGUF stream cursor: keep the checked logical metadata position in 64 bits
   instead of calling `tellg()` before every field. Small metadata skips consume
   the existing stream buffer; large arrays still use a bounded 64-bit seek.
   This avoids libc++ buffer invalidation without loosening bounds or loading
   tensor payloads. Remove when upstream provides an equivalent buffered reader.

6. Repository-native file I/O: preserve 64-bit safetensors sizes/positions;
   bound and validate header/index JSON, tensor ranges, and local sibling paths.
   Resolve and validate complete standard GGUF shard groups without concatenating
   or rewriting the original files. Duplicate/missing tensors and inconsistent
   shard metadata fail closed. This patch does not add application model recipes.

7. Qwen timestep activation: use out-of-place SiLU under `SD_BROWSER_WEBGPU`.
   Qwen Image 2.1's BF16 first linear may run on CPU while the runner pins its
   supported SiLU to WebGPU. An in-place output retains a CPU `view_src` despite
   the scheduler copying `src[0]` to WebGPU; binding that output as a WebGPU buffer
   traps before shader execution. Keep the original activation formula, weight
   types and backend selection; only the result allocation changes. Other builds
   retain the upstream in-place path. See `tests/qwen-timestep-probe.cpp` for the
   actual Qwen block's alias/placement/numerical regression. Remove this patch
   only after a reviewed upstream equivalent makes the mixed-BF16 placement and
   numerical regression pass. If the upstream scheduler safely relocates views,
   adapt the probe's pre-allocation no-view assertion as part of that review.

The smoke fixture reports byte ranges and total bytes rather than guessing from
read-call counts. Its 4 KiB chunk / 256 KiB total budget applies only to the tiny
synthetic fixture; it is not a metadata or model size limit in the core. Runtime
input size and source chunking remain caller-owned.

Real GPU numerical parity, large dispatches, all architectures and quantizations
are not certified. There is no application resolution cap, sampler selection,
GPU budget or Qwen-specific sampling policy in these patches or the bridge.

Removal criteria: replace each patch with an upstream equivalent when its same
threading/normalization/memory/large-file tests pass. Never silently skip a failed
patch, relax input hashes, or substitute a different upstream revision.
